Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful.

Key components of NLP include tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and syntactic parsing. These techniques allow NLP models to process large volumes of text efficiently.

One of the most widely used applications of NLP is machine translation, where algorithms like Google Translate convert text from one language to another. Another key application is text summarization, which helps extract key information from lengthy documents.

Recent advancements in NLP have been driven by deep learning models such as transformers, including BERT, GPT, and Gemini. These models leverage large-scale datasets and self-attention mechanisms to improve accuracy and contextual understanding.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach in NLP, enhancing generative models by incorporating relevant external knowledge. By retrieving information from vector databases before generating text, RAG significantly improves response relevance and factual correctness.

NLP continues to evolve, with applications spanning chatbots, voice assistants, content moderation, and more. With the integration of multimodal AI, future NLP models will become even more sophisticated in understanding and generating human-like text.
